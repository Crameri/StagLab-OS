# StagLab-OpenSky

StagLab-OpenSky is a developer version branched from StagLab 6.0 (https://www.fabiocrameri.ch/staglab).
This version is intended for developers to add and trackchange their individual routines to StagLab themselves. Some of additions will find their way into the original version of StagLab, others will remain in this version accessible to other users.

Currently, due to time restrictions, testing of new additions is up to the developers themselves.
